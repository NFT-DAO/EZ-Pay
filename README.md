# Welcome to EZ Pay API Connector

This project is free to use and is open source.  The project was funded by Cardano in Fund 5 and completed in April 2022.

As this is a backend system to enable payments with Paypal, Stripe and Venmo we have included a sample front-end system to demonstrate HOW this code can work.

We have also created a video showing how this front end demo works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDkfWYnr1Wg&ab_channel=NikaRevazishvili

IMPORTANT NOTE

You will need to have your own Stripe, Paypal and/or Venmo account in order to use this service.  Each account can be set up relatively easily at their
respective website.

Once you have your account keys, the sample file .env allows you to insert your key and for the application to work seamlessly.
As with ALL programs around money and assets, please guard your Paypal, Stripe and Venmo keys - do not share them with anyone, which includes
NFT DAO.  We do not need any aplication key for you to use this program.
